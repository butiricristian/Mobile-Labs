<h1>Booky</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
  The main purpose of this application is to store book titles that the user plans to read and to help him finish them in the amount of time that he wishes. This means that the application will compute the number of pages the user needs to read per day in order for him to finish in time and keep notifying him when the reading time begins.
  The app will also offer the possibility for the user to store favourite quotes and remarks about the book. After finishing reading, an option for giving a review to the book and sharing the stored quotes will be prompted.
  Taking all these features into consideration, the application aims to improve its users' productivity by helping them to achieve their cultural or professional development goals.
